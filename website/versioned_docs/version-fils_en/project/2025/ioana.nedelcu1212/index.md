## Description

When booting up the game, you will be prompted to pick one of the available songs and the difficulty which you wish to play on. You can then input a 3 character username. The gameplay itself consists of pressing the buttons to the rhythm of the song you selected with the aid of the visual interface. Hitting the correct button(s) at the right time adds to your score. If it is high enough, your score will be registered to the leaderboard (for the song and difficulty that you played), which shows the username of the 5 top scoring users.

## Motivation

While being more familiar with mobile, touch-screen based rhythm games, I've always been fascinated by the larger-scale arcade machines, which offer more of a physical, tactile response. I hope to put the technical knowledge I have gained throughout the semester to use by bringing to life a pocket-sized version of the arcade experience.

## Log

### Week 6 - 12 May
Finished ordering any remaining parts that I might have needed. My components ended up requiring more current than I was expecting so I couldn't power everything using the pico as I had planned (went for a battery + step down module set up instead). Brought KiCad scheme in its final form.

### Week 7 - 19 May
<!-- I made the KiCad Schematic for the project. Because I couldn't find any symbol for Pico Display Pack, I created it and added to the schematic. -->
<!-- I created the stage and added it to the circuit having now the final shape of it. -->

### Week 20 - 26 May
<!-- I started the software and finished it, while also doing final improvements to my project. -->

## Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico W Microcontroller**: Coordinates all of the components.
2. **Buttons**: Game input.
3. **Buzzer**: Audio feedback for game inputs.
4. **MP3 Player Module**: Reads song from a microSD card.
5. **Speaker**: Ouputs song.
6. **Display**: Visual output device, displays the game elements (falling notes, score, menus). 
7. **Breadboard**: Used for building the circuit.
8. **Wires**: Used for connecting the components.
