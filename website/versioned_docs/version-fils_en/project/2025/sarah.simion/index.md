## Description

The goals of this project is to use the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller to build a basic retro portable console. A joystick and a few buttons are used for movement, navigation and selection. The games will have a classic gaming vibe, for this I choose the games "Pong" and "Snake", along with a simple menu system.

## Motivation

I choose this idea because I am currently very passionate about games and I enjoy playing games on both computer and consoles, but I haven't experienced the retro gaming consoles world and thought that if it is possible to make one myself now I would really enjoy the making of it and definitely the using of it.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

I attached all the components and made a suitable kicad schmatic.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I added a debugger and I tried testing the wiring to the display with a simple code of the spi connection.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

This are the hardware parts that I would like to use:

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W (main microcontroller)
- LCD SPI 1.8"(128x160) Display
- TP4056 Lipo Charger Module
- 300 mAh Battery
- KCD10-101 Switch
- PS2 Joystick Module and a few buttons
- simple PCB boards
