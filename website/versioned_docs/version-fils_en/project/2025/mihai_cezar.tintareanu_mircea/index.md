## Description
Picture this: It's Saturday night. You've returned from university, exhausted your gaming options, and suddenly spot your old chess board gathering dust in the corner. Nostalgia hits and you feel like a game of over the board chess is exactly what you need. But there's a problem—who's going to play with you? Enter the Smart Chess project. No more desperately calling friends who can barely distinguish a rook from a pawn, or interrupting your father's weekend relaxation time. And let's be serious, no online chess platform could ever beat the tactile feeling of moving chess pieces across the board. Now you are going to face much better oponents and take a taste of the real deal!

## Motivation

I have always been into chess. Ever since I was a kid I participated in countless chess competitions across the country. Although I had always had strong oponents and friends to play with, there were times where I was simply left alone, with no one to play against. I wanted to play over the board chess, the real deal, not in browser over some interface. This project bridges that gap—delivering the traditional, tactile chess experience that I love but updated for the 21st century.

## Architecture 

The core of the system revolves around the detection of chess piece positions through Hall effect sensors and Bluetooth communication with a chess engine.

This project diagram illustrates the connectivity of the system utilizing a Arduino Nano ESP32 as the main controller. The Arduino Nano ESP32 is connected to various components including four multiplexers which are connected to sixty four hall effect sensors themselves, as well as an LCD 16x2 Character Display with an I2C controller.

___

**Arduino Nano ESP32:**
- **Role**: Acts as the "brain" of the system — reads sensor data, manages chess game state, communicates via Bluetooth, and controls the LCD display 
- **Connections**: GPIO pins for multiplexer control (S0-S3) and multiplexer input, I2C interface for LCD, Bluetooth for laptop communication 
- **Features**: Dual-core operation (BLE on APP core, sensor reading on main core)

___

**Hall Effect Sensors (A3144):**

- **Display**: 16 characters × 2 lines for move notation and game status

___

**Laptop with Bluetooth:**
- **Role**: Runs Stockfish chess engine and processes move calculations 
- **Communication**: Receives board state via Bluetooth, returns calculated moves to ESP32 
- **Function**: Provides AI opponent for the physical chess board

___

**Power System**
- **Primary**: +12V DC power supply unit (PSU)
- **Regulation**: Step-down voltage regulator converting to +5V DC
- **Distribution**: Powers all components (sensors, multiplexers, ESP32, LCD)

## Log

### Week 6 - 12 May

Once the project had been approved I had began researching the components that I needed as well as building the framework of the chess board. Since then I have assembled a debug board with all the necessary components in order to test the behavior of the sensors and I have also started builiding the data transmission pipeline with the use of Bluetooth.

### Week 7 - 19 May

After outlining a roadmap and documenting the project's architecture, I began assembling the hardware components.

The first step involved modifying each chess piece to accommodate a magnet. Using a drill, I created cavities inside each piece and securely glued a neodymium magnet in place using silicone rubber. This allows the Hall effect sensors to detect the presence of each piece.

![piecesandboard](piecesandboard.webp)

One of the most challenging tasks was soldering the connections for the 64 Hall effect sensors. Each sensor has three pins (VCC, GND, and output), which adds up to a total of 192 individual connections. This required careful planning and patience to ensure all joints were clean and reliable.

Additionally, since the wires coming from each output pin of the Hall sensors had to be inserted into breadboards but didn’t have headers attached, I had to solder pins onto each individual output wire.

![multiplexersupdate](multiplexerupdate.webp)

Besides that, I had to make sure that the "wire management" is well done so that I won't have to deal with a nightmare of wires behind the scenes. So I labeled each and every single sensor as well as its output pin wire according to their position on the chess board.

A wooden plate was also added to the side, in order to accommodate the two breadboards and two small wooden side walls, which will later be used to support a protective plexiglass cover. This enclosure is intended to shield the breadboards and components from accidental mechanical damage

### Week 20 - 26 May

## Hardware

Arduino Nano ESP32: Acts as the brain of the operation, running the Rust firmware

Hall Effect Sensors: One for each square (64 total), detecting magnetic presence

CD74HC4067 Multiplexers: Manage the input from 64 sensors

Chess Board: Standard 8x8 board with internal sensor array

Chess Pieces: Standard pieces fitted with neodymium magnets

1602 LCD with I2C Controller: Displays chess engine moves and game information

### Schematics

Here is presented the KiCad schematic:

For ease of understanding, only one Hall effect sensor is represented as to not clutter the schematic.
