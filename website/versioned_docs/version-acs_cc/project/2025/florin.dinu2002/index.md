## Description

The project uses Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and proximity sensors to monitor the occupancy of parking spaces. When a car enters, the system detects where it is parked and updates a 7-segment digital display, which counts the number of free spaces in the parking lot.

## Motivation

Why did you choose this project?

​I chose to develop this project to address the growing challenges of vehicle parking in congested urban areas. The rapid growth of the number of cars often exceeds the capacity of the existing parking infrastructure, leading to congestion, additional carbon emissions and time loss for drivers looking for a free space.​

The implementation of a smart parking system, based on Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and proximity sensors, allows for real-time monitoring of parking space occupancy. By displaying the number of available spaces on a 7-segment digital display, drivers can be promptly informed about parking availability, thus reducing the time spent searching for a space and contributing to traffic flow.​


## Architecture 
 
    
   A 7-segment display has segments A–G and sometimes a dot (DP). Each segment connects to a Shift Register pin, then to the Pico.

| E       | Q4            |
| F       | Q5            |
| G       | Q6            |
