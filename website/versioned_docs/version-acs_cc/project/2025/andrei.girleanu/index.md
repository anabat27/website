## Description

My projects consists of developing a 2-wheeled robot that has in front of it a ball caster,
using Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. The robot will be controlled with a phone application.
I am also going to install a rotating sensor on the top of the robot that will send informations
to the application about the observed obstacles such as the distance and direction untill objects.

## Motivation

I always wanted to learn how to build a mini-car controlled by my phone. I find my ideea very interesting and I also think that it is a quite challenging project and, after a hard work, I am looking forward to play with the robot I created. It is also a useful project because, whenever you are bored, you can use the project as a matter of entertainment.

## Architecture

UI:
I am using a phone application connected via wi-fi to control the movement of the robort.
On the phone, I also receive data about detected objects nearby the robot.

Components: The phone communicates through wi-fi with the microcontroller. Pico is connected with L298N, which has its own connection with the DC motors. Pico is also connected with the sensor and the servo motor.

## Log

### Week 27 April - 4 May

I thought about what improvements I could make to the main idea of ​​the robot. I researched how I could build a mini car, what materials I would need and which device to use to control it.

### Week 4 May - 18 May

In these weeks, I bought all the hardware components and assembled the mini car. I also designed the case for the robot.

## Hardware

Raspberry Pi Pico 2W: Microcontroller with Wi-Fi integrated for the interraction of the application,
acts as the central controller.\
L298N Dual Motor Driver Module Red: Used for the rotation of the sensor placed above the robot.\
Micro Servo Motor SG90 180°: Controls steering.\
DC motor 3V-6V with 1:48 reducer: Drives the robot's wheels, providing high torque and controlled movement at low speeds.\
Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04: It detects the obstacles and sends information to the application.\
Cables of all types, to connect the components: Male-to-Male, Male-to-Female, Female-to-Female.\
Breadboard: Where components are assembled together.\
Ball Caster: Used as a "front wheel".
