## Description

A device which uses a colour sensor in order to sort
candies based on their colours. The identified colour
is then displayed on a LCD screen and a LED is turned on
corresponding with the respective colour.


+ The system utilizes a sensor to identify colour of the candy.

+ The pipe is rotated to a pre-calculated angle, based on the colour of the candy so it drops in a special glass.

+ A servomotor then rotates the bottom side of the earrings box and the candy drops into an improvised funnel through the pipe and into the correct glass.

+ The LCD screen showcases the colour of the candy.

+ LEDs are then turned on based on the colour.

+ Both servomotors rotated back to their initial state and another candy is ready to be dropped.


## Motivation

**This project** reflects my desire to dive deeper into embedded programming using a new language — **Rust**. I chose Rust for its performance and safety, and because it's becoming a strong player in the embedded world.

As a kid, I was fascinated by M&M’s candy dispensers and often imagined building one that could **sort candies by flavour or color**. That idea stuck with me and inspired this project.

While planning the system, from sensors to microcontrollers,  I realized it’s more than just code. It’s also about designing and building the physical device, something that taps into my love for **arts and crafts**.

## Architecture 
The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** serves as the central control unit, directing and managing all other components utilized within the project.

The **LCD** serves as an interface for showcasing the colour of the candy, it is connected to the Pico through I2C

The **servomotors** are responsible for rotating the candy and the pipe, ensuring that the candy is dropped into the correct glass.

The **LED** lights up in the corresponding colour of the candy, providing a visual indication of the detected colour. 

The **colour sensor** identifies the colour of the candy and sends the data to the Pico for processing.

The **pipe** is rotated to a pre-calculated angle based on the colour of the candy, ensuring it drops into the correct glass.

The **earrings box** is used to create a makeshift arm, which is rotated by the servomotor. This arm is responsible for holding the candy and dropping it into the correct glass.

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

I started the project by gathering all the necessary components and setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. I also began researching the TCS230 colour sensor and how to interface it with the Pico. After that, I began wiring all the components together, testing the connections, then hit a really rough blockage with the LCD display. I was unable to get it to work, so I decided to use a different one, the 1602 LCD with I2C interface. After searching the internet for hours trying to find a crate, I finally found one that worked.

### Week 12 - 18 May

Began putting all the pieces into place and designed the structure of the funnel and the way the candy will be dropped. The code is almost done, I just need to calibrate the angles of the servomotors and the color sensor to better recognise the colors. I am also attaching a drive link to a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10OZsfYCC7r9oA9sq6YKw8RO7cOUaYR02/view?usp=sharing) of the candy sorter in action which is almost complete software-wise.

## Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**:
- **Purpose**: Controls all components.
- **Function**: Acts as the main controller, coordinating the operations of sensors, motors, buzzers, and the LCD display.

2. **Colour Sensor**:
- **Purpose**: Detects the colour of the candy.
- **Function**: Identifies the colour of the candy and sends the data to the Raspberry Pi Pico for processing.

3. **LCD Display**:
- **Purpose**: Displays the detected colour of the candy.
- **Function**: Provides a visual interface for the user, showing the colour of the candy detected by the sensor.

4. **Servomotor**:
- **Purpose**: Rotates the candy and the pipe.
- **Function**: Controls the movement of the candy and the pipe, ensuring that the candy is dropped into the correct glass.

5. **LED**:
- **Purpose**: Provides a visual indication of the detected colour.
- **Function**: Lights up in the corresponding colour of the candy, providing a visual indication of the detected colour.

### Hardware Overview:
- The **Raspberry Pi Pico** controls and coordinates all components.
- The **LCD** displays the detected colour of the candy.
- The **servomotors** rotate the candy and the pipe, ensuring that the candy is dropped into the correct glass.
- The **LED** lights up in the corresponding colour of the candy.
- The **colour sensor** identifies the colour of the candy and sends the data to the Pico for processing.
