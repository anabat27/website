## Description

A device that monitors soil humidity and ambient temperature to automatically water a plant when needed. It also uses LED indicators to visually display the current moisture level of the soil.

- The system uses a capacitive soil moisture sensor v2.0 to measure soil humidity.

- A DHT22 sensor detects the air temperature and humidity.

- A mini water pump is activated automatically via a MOSFET (STP55NF06L), controlled by the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

- LEDs (green, yellow, red) indicate the soil moisture status visually.

- The water pump is powered separately via a 2x18650 battery pack and a step-down voltage module to ensure stable 5V output.

## Motivation

**This project** reflects my interest in diving deeper into embedded systems using **Rust**, a language known for its speed and safety. It also solves a practical problem — helping maintain healthy plants automatically.

While planning this system, I realized it's not only about writing code, but also about integrating hardware, sensors, and electronics — a hands-on approach that connects creativity with engineering.

## Architecture

The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** acts as the central controller, managing all components in the system.

The **capacitive soil moisture sensor v2.0** provides a more accurate and stable analog reading of soil water content.

The **DHT22 sensor** reads the ambient air temperature and humidity.

The **MOSFET STP55NF06L** controls the activation of the **mini water pump** based on moisture and temperature conditions.

**LED indicators**:

- **Green LED**: Soil is well-watered
- **Yellow LED**: Soil is moderately moist
- **Red LED**: Soil is dry (triggers watering)

The **2x18650 battery pack** supplies power to the water pump, regulated to 5V by an **LM2596 step-down module**.
