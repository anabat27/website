## Description

The purpose of this project is to build an automated machine for counting
Romanian banknotes of various denominations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500
lei). The device will automatically detect and recognize each inserted banknote
using specialized sensors that identify color, size or other distinctive
features. After recognition, the value of the banknote will be added to a
running total, which is displayed in real time on a 4-digit 7-segment display.
The system allows continuous insertion of multiple banknotes and when a reset
button is pressed, the total sum is reset to zero and the small door at the back
of the machine is unlocked, granting access to the storage compartment. Thus,
the machine functions both as a fast-counting system and as a temporary security
mechanism for the banknotes until the reset button is pressed.





## Motivation

I chose to develop this project because it combines several areas of personal
interest, such as electronics, programming, and real-time data processing. The
idea of creating a device capable of automatically recognize and process
banknotes is an exciting technical challenge that involves both circuit design
and the development of identification algorithms. Moreover, such a device has
practical applications in fields like commerce or financial security to reduce
human error and increase efficiency.





## Architecture

Main Components:

1) Banknote Identification System

– Responsible for identifying banknotes.

– At the hardware level, it includes printer rollers, a printer motor, a TCS230
color sensor with 4 LEDs connected to GPIO pins 6, 7, 8, and 9, and two presence
sensors connected to GPIO pins 14 and 15. The motor is powered at 12V and
receives control signals via GPIO pin 4.

2) Raspberry Pi Pico 2 Board

– Mounted on a 830-pin breadboard.

3) Display Module

– A 4-digit 7-segment display used to show the current amount (in Romanian leu
and bani).

4) Reset and Access Control Module

– A reset button that, when it is pressed, resets the displayed amount and
unlocks the back door. There will also be an on/off button to power the system
on or off.





Connections Between Components:

-The Pico board is mounted on an 830-point breadboard.

-All components are controlled from the Pico; the motor driving the rollers and
the lock are activated via 3.3V-controlled relays.

-GPIO pins 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are used for communication with the TCS230 color
sensor.

-GPIO pin 3 controls the electromagnetic lock (it opens when reset is pressed)
-GPIO pin 4 controls the motor that drives the rollers through Relay 1.

-GPIO pin 5 controls the lightbulb inside the dark chamber, where banknote reading is made

-GPIO pin 15 receives data from the first presence sensor (when a banknote is
detected, the motor starts → GPIO 4 is set to high).

-GPIO pin 14 receives data from the second presence sensor (stops the banknote
inside the box for RGB reading).

-GPIO pins 19, 20, 21, and 22 are used for presence sensors for 1, 5, 10, and 50
bani coins, respectively (they increment the value when a coin passes).
-The LCD 1602 uses only 2 pins from the MCU, 16 for SDA and 17 for SCL (LCD 1602 uses I2C as communication protocol)

-GPIO pin 11 is an input pin for the ON/OFF button, helping reduce power
consumption.

-GPIO pin 13 is an input pin for the RESET button. When pressed, the rear door
unlocks, the displayed total resets to 0, and the user can collect the stored
money.

## Log:


### Week 10 April – 16 April

-I purchased the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board and debugger and connected them.

-I successfully ran the first cargo run, which displayed “Hello World!”.

-I configured the TCS230 color sensor (used GPIO pins 6, 7, 8, and 9 as outputs
and pin 10 as input).

-RGB values are correctly displayed in the program for different environments.



### Week 17 April – 23 April:

-I wrote code to integrate presence sensors into the project (programmed GPIO
pins 14 and 15).

-I modified the code to implement the banknote counting machine as a state
machine (with states: Idle, Start, Stop, Read, and Eject).

-I used a relay to correctly control the motor that pulls banknotes using
rollers.



### Week 24 April – 1 May:

-I wrote the project documentation, including all used components and the KiCad
schematic.

-I tested the TCS230 color sensor in a dark environment (inside a box) to
consistently read the same color for banknotes, minimizing the effect of ambient
light.


### Week 1 May – 7 May:

-I connected the presence sensors to pins 19, 20, 21, and 22 for the 4 types of 
coins (1 ban, 5 bani, 10 bani, and 50 bani).

-I calibrated the presence sensors to detect objects at the correct distance 
(initially, they were detecting at too great a distance).

-I built the coin separator (mechanical part).

-I tried to program a 7-segment display to work via the SPI protocol (I stayed 
in the lab until 11 PM on May 9th).

### Week 8 May – 14 May:

-I purchased a new LCD display (lcd1602), which works via I2C.

-I used [`embassy_rp::peripherals::I2C0`](https://docs.rs/embassy-rp/latest/embassy_rp/peripherals/struct.I2C0.html) 
to make it functional.

-The display has GND, VCC, SDA, and SCL connections.

-I used pins 16 and 17 on the Pico for SDA and SCL.

-It can now display all kinds of characters (letters, numbers, and punctuation).

-I built a new banknote slot (the old one was too long and the banknotes didn’t align properly with the rollers).

-I added a door sensor to detect whether it is open or closed (not yet connected to the board).

### Week 15 May – 21 May:

-To be continued

## Hardware

The hardware design of the project includes a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 with 2 MB
Flash and 264 KB RAM, powered by a step-down 3.3V–5A power supply. An 8-channel
opto-isolated relay module (3.3V compatible) is used to control external
devices. Banknotes are recognized using a TCS230 color sensor, while detection
of coins and banknotes is done through 8 infrared obstacle sensors. Connections
between components are made with female-to-male jumper wires, and the security
of the collected banknotes is ensured by an electromagnetic lock.


### [Motor](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4001294507915.html)
-A component used to spin the roles to take the banknote inside

-it works at 9V, so I have a LM7809 between the 12V source and the motor

-it can spin both ways

-can eject banknote if it is not recognized by the color sensor

### Relay
-I used a [relay](https://ampul.eu/cs/rele-magneticke-kontakty/3941-modul-8-rele-s-optickym-oddelenim-33v) with 3.3V command and 8 channels, because PICO can give output only up to 3.3V. So, a 5V relay will not work.

-I used the first 4 channels. First channel is from pin 4 (output) that controls the motor. Second one is for light bulb (pin 5), that activates only when I read the banknote. 

-the third channel is for electromagnetic lock.

-the fourth one is used for the motor (but this time backwards).

### [TCS230 color sensor](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/en/optical-sensors/1854-blue-tcs230-color-sensor-module.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20868596392&gbraid=0AAAAADv-p3C89WEw3rF-wI7dDqJt-i0N-&gclid=CjwKCAjw_pDBBhBMEiwAmY02Nn7UqWH3XvXoJSabxmtseDuVm4aQH_EgTjFWKfGaQxev41fdBL5hEBoCsW4QAvD_BwE)
-used to see colors for banknotes

-it uses 5 pins on my Pico (4 for input, one for output)

-I made a dark chamber for this sensor, because it may get influenced by the outside light.

-It has 8 pins(S0,S1,S2,S3 input in the sensor, out is input in the MCU on pin 10, gnd, vcc and output enable)

### [Presence sensors with infrared](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/en/optical-sensors/4514-infrared-obstacle-sensor.html?search_query=infrared&results=156)
-the best option to check if something moved.

-I calibrated them using a screwdriver, each of them can detect objects up to 2 cm in front of them

-Each sensor has 3 pins: VCC, GND and OUT. OUT goes in my MCU on the INPUT pins.

### [1602 LCD](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/en/lcds/2894-1602-lcd-with-i2c-interface-and-blue-backlight.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20868596392&gbraid=0AAAAADv-p3C89WEw3rF-wI7dDqJt-i0N-&gclid=CjwKCAjw_pDBBhBMEiwAmY02NhSRhh6ZWsS9qRrYm8ebIyKZ_fdj1R9oZmFWQkiGQcS6CHtxoeJvFxoCkyoQAvD_BwE)
-It uses only 2 pins from my MCU (pin 16 SDA and pin 17 SCL)

-It comunicates via I2C, at a frequency of 100KHz.

-It prints any characters I need


### Reserved Pins
Pins 0, 1, and 2 are unavailable as they are used by the SC0889 debugger, which is Raspberry Pi compatible.
Pin 2 is GND, and it is also connected to the debugger.

### Outputs
#### Pin 2 - Motor Control (Backward)
-Controls the backward motion of a motor (HP model [RK-370CA-14420](https://datasheet4u.com/pdf-down/R/K/-/RK-370CAMABUCHI.pdf)). When the banknote can't be recognized by my sensor, the pin 4 becomes
inactive and pin 2 becomes active. It spins back for 0.5 seconds in order to eject the banknote.
#### Pin 3 – Electromagnetic Lock Control
-Acts as a GPIO output.

-LOW: Lock is engaged (closed).

-HIGH: Lock is disengaged (open).

#### Pin 4 – Motor Control (Forward)
-Controls the forward motion of a motor (HP model [RK-370CA-14420](https://datasheet4u.com/pdf-down/R/K/-/RK-370CAMABUCHI.pdf)).
When the presence sensor in the slot (connected to pin 15) detects a banknote, the motor is activated.
The banknote is pulled in until a second presence sensor (connected to pin 14) detects it.
Once detected, the motor stops, and the TCS230 color sensor begins reading the banknote.

#### Pin 5 – 12V Light Control
Powers a 12V light.

The light turns on during the banknote reading process.

#### Pin 27 – Buzzer Control
-Controls a buzzer.

-Activated when the door is open or under error conditions.

#### Pin 28 – Status LEDs
-Controls red LEDs when the machine is working or the door is open.
Controls green LEDs when the machine is in standby mode.

### [TCS230 Color Sensor](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/en/optical-sensors/1854-blue-tcs230-color-sensor-module.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20868596392&gbraid=0AAAAADv-p3C89WEw3rF-wI7dDqJt-i0N-&gclid=CjwKCAjw_pDBBhBMEiwAmY02Nn7UqWH3XvXoJSabxmtseDuVm4aQH_EgTjFWKfGaQxev41fdBL5hEBoCsW4QAvD_BwE)
-The TCS230 sensor uses a 100 kHz PWM signal to analyze the colors of the banknotes, allowing for a quick response during processing.

-Outputs a PWM (Pulse-Witdh Modulation) signal (frequency modulation).

-Pins 6 and 7 (Output): Control the output frequency.

-Pins 8 and 9 (Output): Control color filter selection.

-Pin 10 (Input): Receives RGB data.

### Inputs
#### Pin 11 – On/Off Button:
-Used for low-power toggling of the device.

#### Pin 13 – Reset Button:
-When pressed, it sends a command via Pin 3 to open the lock.

-The screen displays 0 for the sum introduced.

-If the door sensor becomes inactive, the buzzer is triggered for 0.5 seconds with a 1-second pause.

### [Presence Sensors](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/en/optical-sensors/4514-infrared-obstacle-sensor.html?search_query=infrared&results=156)
-In this project, I use 7 presence sensors. There are 4 for coins, 2 for banknotes and one for door.

-I calibrated these presence sensors using a screwdriver.

-I have set the sensors to not detect beyond 2 cm, because they can interfere with the materials around them.

##### Pin 14 (Input):
-Connected to the second presence sensor (near TCS230).

-Detects the arrival of the banknote and signals the MCU to stop the motor.


#### Pin 15 (Input):
-Connected to the first presence sensor (inside the banknote slot).

-Activates the motor to start pulling the banknote.

#### Pins 19, 20, 21, 22 (Input):
-Connected to four presence sensors, each detecting a different coin type (1, 5, 10, 50).

#### Pin 26 (Input):
-Door sensor: If no presence is detected, the door is considered open, and the buzzer must be activated.

### [LCD Display – 1602 (2 Rows × 16 Characters)](https://www.optimusdigital.ro/en/lcds/2894-1602-lcd-with-i2c-interface-and-blue-backlight.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20868596392&gbraid=0AAAAADv-p3C89WEw3rF-wI7dDqJt-i0N-&gclid=CjwKCAjw_pDBBhBMEiwAmY02NhSRhh6ZWsS9qRrYm8ebIyKZ_fdj1R9oZmFWQkiGQcS6CHtxoeJvFxoCkyoQAvD_BwE)
-Pins 16 (SDA) and 17 (SCL)

-Used for I2C communication with the LCD via a PCF8574 expander.

-The 1602 LCD uses a transmission speed of 100 kHz for I2C communication, ensuring a quick update of the information on the display.

#### Initialization:
-The display is initialized using a custom lcd_init function.

#### Data Transmission:
-I used this datasheet to see exactly how lcd 1602 actually works: [datasheet LCD 1602](https://www.waveshare.com/datasheet/LCD_en_PDF/LCD1602.pdf)

-Each byte is split into high nibble and low nibble

-Each nibble is sent in two steps: With EN signal activated (with_en) and With EN signal deactivated (without)

-After transmitting a full byte, the system waits 2 ms before continuing.


### Power consumption
I have 2 circuits:

-one at 5V, including Raspberry Pi Pico, TCS230 Color Sensor,all 7 presence sensors and the lcd 1602

-one at 12V, featuring the engine, the lightbulb and some other leds.

## Software



The code I wrote controls a system on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 for detecting
banknotes. It uses presence sensors to detect when a banknote is inserted, and a
TCS230 color sensor to read its RGB values. The motor is started or stopped
based on the banknote’s position, and the RGB frequencies are normalized to
identify the note’s color. The code handles concurrent tasks and delays using
libraries like embassy_executor and embassy_time.
