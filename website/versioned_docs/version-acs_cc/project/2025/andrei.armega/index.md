## Description

The project revolves around — as much as fictional laser technology allows — a lightsaber, the iconic weapon from the *Star Wars* franchise. Instead of Kyber crystals from Ilum, the blade will be powered by batteries and an addressable LED strip (WS2811). Iconic sound effects will be played through a speaker, while a gyroscope detects movement to trigger those sounds. Finally, all components will be encapsulated in a DIY hilt.



## Motivation

The primary drive behind this project is simple: **lightsabers are cool**. Beyond that, it brings a fun and creative break from the seriousness of everyday life and demonstrates embedded systems in an engaging way.


## Architecture

### 3D Model

### Components

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**
- **LED strip WS2811**
- **Level Shifter HW-221**
- **Gyroscope MPU6500**
- **Current Source Stabilizer (5V to 3.3V)**
- **LiPo Battery: GENS ACE Tattu 7.6V / 300 mA / 75C**
- **Amplifier: MAX98357A**
- **4-pin Buttons**
- **Breadboards**


## Log

### Week 5 (May 11)
- Created the initial documentation, 3D concept, and schematic of the project.
- Ordered all the necessary components.
- Researched libraries for audio and LED control.

### Week 12 (May 18)
- Wired the final circuit.
- Flashed the debugger with the uf2 file.
- Coded the functionality for an incipient version of the LED strip.

### Week 19 (May 25)
*(To be filled)*


## Hardware

We use two **Raspberry Pi Pico W** boards — one for the core functionality, the other for debugging.

Movement detection (e.g., to play a _whoosh_ sound) is done using the **MPU6500 gyroscope**.

For sound output, we use an **8Ω 2W speaker** and a **MAX98357A amplifier**.

The lightsaber blade is illuminated using a **WS2811 addressable LED strip**. A **level shifter** ensures proper communication between the 3.3V logic of the Pico and the 5V LEDs.

Power is supplied via a **7.6V LiPo battery**, regulated to 5V and 3.3V using a **power supply module**.

User input (powering on/off, switching modes) is handled via **4-pin push button**.
